--- TOOD SECTION
-- TODO: do a thing wherein we deal with the problem with leaf nodes not evaluating to anything. THIS IS WHERE I CAN USE A MAYBE A MONAD
-- TODO: Sometimes need to use synonymns when doing anagrams ??? Maybe anagram subtypes needs to be a special type of subtree
-- TODO: we don't want to have insertInto 'abc' 'xyz' = abcxyz
-- TODO: Change subtraction eval function to insert, obvs
-- TODO: AHH I need to check if the answer is in a word (or phrase) list.
-- TODO: Add some abbreviation function
-- TODO: Reversal clues
-- TODO: First/last letter clues
-- TODO: Before/after clues
-- TODO: Only create definitions where the thing we're defining is in our wordlist -> MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT!!!
