MAIN BODY WRITEUP STRUCTURE

1. Naive Implementation
	1. Discussion of different clue types
	2. State space and performance
	3. Loading in an unsafe IO manner
	4. Discussion of the Anagram Nodes -> could we thread it?

2. Simplifications in the Cons nodes

3. Matching the Human Solver's thought process

	1. Constrain length while parsing
	2. Constrain length while solving
	3. Constrain against known wordlist
	4. Constrain against synonymns
	5. Constrain based on initial letters of the word

4. State space considerations and solving based on most probable parse trees
	
	1. Evaluation functions
	2. Weighting based on ML and arg minimization

5. A benchmarking suite and performance against it
	
	1. Clues from real newspapers
	2. A solution markup and automated verification => is answer enough or do we just want to provide a method
	3. Rating clues on a scale / on multiple scales

6. Data considerations

	1. Corpus / wordlist
	2. Conjugated forms -> match case
	3. Knowledge -> capital of Paris
	4. Derived knowledge -> Qulog to create knowlegebase?

7. Extension activities

	1. Solving an entire grid using partial letters
	2. Using partial information to create best guesses
	3. Automated learning
